This project aims to help all team members self-teach and grow data science skills together, by tackling the following open-source topic. Roughly, the project will go through these phases:
* (1) Data Exploration (with visualizations to find and demonsrtate features / trends/ relations)
* (2) Analysis (through observing dataframes and visualizations)
* (3) Supervised Machine Learning (near the end when the team feels more technically prepared)

### Some links for self-learning:
(note by Vel: I'm still in the middle of both 2. and 3. myself so we could discuss any confusing section if needs be)
- [0.CS224U: Natural Language Understanding, Stanford University](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224u/)

- [1. Learn Python Programming Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WaiAkEdcF5VR3o=/) by Tim Buchalka et al
  - This one is great anyone looking to learn from absolute 0. Helped me quite a bit back in the days. Never really finished it tho.

- [2. Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WaUAkEdcF5VR3o=/) by Jose Portilla
  - I recommend trying this one out first before attempting the next one
  
- [3. Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WciAkEdcF5VR3o=/) by Hadelin de Ponteves et al
  - You can skip some R sections and just focus on the math-heavy ones with sample Python codes

- [4. Artificial Intelligence A-Z™: Learn How To Build An AI](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WpyAkEdcF5VR3o=/) by Hadelin de Ponteves et al
  - This one is imo really cool but is quite heavy on the math side. I did not make it far but, **your mileage may vary**.

### Some links for self-learning:
- [1. Learn Python Programming Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WaiAkEdcF5VR3o=/)
  - This one is great anyone looking to learn from absolute 0. Helped me quite a bit back in the days. Though I haven't really finished it lol.

- [2. Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WaUAkEdcF5VR3o=/)
  - I recommend trying this one out first before attempting the next one
- [3. Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WciAkEdcF5VR3o=/)
  - You can skip some R sections and just focus on the math-heavy ones with sample Python codes
(note by Vel: I'm still in the middle of both 2. and 3. myself so we could discuss any confusing section if needs be)

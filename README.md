### Some links for self-learning:
(note by Vel: I'm still in the middle of both 2. and 3. myself so we could discuss any confusing section if needs be)
- [1. Learn Python Programming Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WaiAkEdcF5VR3o=/)
  - This one is great anyone looking to learn from absolute 0. Helped me quite a bit back in the days. Never really finished it tho.

- [2. Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WaUAkEdcF5VR3o=/)
  - I recommend trying this one out first before attempting the next one
- [3. Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WciAkEdcF5VR3o=/)
  - You can skip some R sections and just focus on the math-heavy ones with sample Python codes

- [4. Artificial Intelligence A-Z™: Learn How To Build An AI](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WpyAkEdcF5VR3o=/)
  - This one is imo really cool but is quite heavy on the math side. I did not make it far but, **your mileage may vary**.
